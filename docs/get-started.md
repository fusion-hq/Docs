## Why Fusion ?

Product analytics tools like Mixpanel & Amplitude collect lot of user data. Given rise of data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA etc it doesn't make sense to send your user's data to third-party analytics services.

Big companies have managed to build interal analytics stack to address privacy issue but thats not possible for everyone as building analytics platfrom requires complex data pipelines, lots of engineering efforts and money. With hosted analytics platfroms you end up with huge SaaS bills as you scale.

Fusion solves all these problems by letting you host out of the box analytics suite, giving control over user data, improving privacy, costing 3x less than hosted analytics solution and does not require to build a platfrom from scratch.
