# Data ingestion - Overview

Fusion is an **event-driven** analytics platfrom.
Which means your web/mobile apps send events with some data payloads which are used to contruct reports around user behaviour and product usage

These generated events could be certain action user performed inside your product like visiting a certain page or logging-in or to update certain user data into Fusion for future analysis

## Client Libraries

We provide native SDKs for sending events from your apps currently

- JS Snippet for static website [see here](/data-ingestion/snippet-installation).
- NPM library for single page apps [see here](/data-ingestion/Javascript)
- Mobile & Backend SDKs and APIs (Coming soon...)

## Contact us if you want to contribute to devlopment of SDKs
