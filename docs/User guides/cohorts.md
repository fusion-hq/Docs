# Cohorts

Cohorts are logical group of users who have some common properties or performed a similar event. This cohorts can be used as filter in other analytics reports or you can run analytics on them directly.

Eg: You can create a cohort of users on `Paid` plan or user who completed `Purchase` event.

:::caution

🏗 Cohorts is under development hence you can not create cohorts by event performed & can not use cohorts as filter for time being
